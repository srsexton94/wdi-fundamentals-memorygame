Hello GA!

Here's my memory game project for the SEI pre-work.  Line 34 of my main.js (first line of flipCard()) kept throwing a type error (saying 'this.getAttribute' is not a function) as 'this' was referring to the window, not the cardElement.

I wasn't able to fix that and keep the structure from the instructions - but by moving the flipCard logic into the createBoard function I was able to fix the type error - I hope that's okay!

I'll keep working on the bonus material, but wanted to submit now just to assure I'm on time.

Thanks & best - looking forward to our first day!
